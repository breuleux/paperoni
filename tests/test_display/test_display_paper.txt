Abstract: Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due
to the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts, “correlation shifts,” is
caused by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching
topic of “domain generalization.” In this work, we employ multi-modal
translation networks to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is
sampled out-of-distribution. Learning a generative model from training domains
enables us to translate each training sample under the special characteristics
of other possible domains. We show that by training a predictor solely on the
generated samples, the spurious correlations in training domains average out,
and the invariant features corresponding to true correlations emerge. Our
proposed technique, Expected Domain Translation (EDT), is benchmarked on the
Colored MNIST dataset and drastically improves the state-of-the-art
classification accuracy by 38% with train-domain validation model selection.
