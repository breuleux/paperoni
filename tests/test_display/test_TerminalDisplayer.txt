Abstract: Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due
to the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts, “correlation shifts,” is
caused by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching
topic of “domain generalization.” In this work, we employ multi-modal
translation networks to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is
sampled out-of-distribution. Learning a generative model from training domains
enables us to translate each training sample under the special characteristics
of other possible domains. We show that by training a predictor solely on the
generated samples, the spurious correlations in training domains average out,
and the invariant features corresponding to true correlations emerge. Our
proposed technique, Expected Domain Translation (EDT), is benchmarked on the
Colored MNIST dataset and drastically improves the state-of-the-art
classification accuracy by 38% with train-domain validation model selection.

Abstract: The coordinated contraction of myocytes drives the heart to beat and
circulate blood. Due to the limited spatial resolution of whole heart imaging
and the piecemeal nature of high-magnification studies, a confirmed model of
myofiber geometry does not yet exist. Using microscopy and computer vision we
report the first three-dimensional reconstruction of myofibers across entire
mouse ventricular walls at the micron scale, representing a gain of three orders
of magnitude in spatial resolution over the existing models. Our analysis
reveals prominent longitudinal bands of fibers that are orthogonal to the well-
known circumferential ones. Our discovery impacts present understanding of heart
wall mechanics and electrical function, with fundamental implications for the
study of diseases related to myofiber disorganization.

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty is the part of out-of-sample prediction error
due to the lack of knowledge of the learner. Whereas previous work was focus-ing
on model variance, we propose a principled approach for directly estimating
epistemic uncertainty by learning to predict generalization error and
subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty, i.e., intrinsic
unpredictability. This estimator of epistemic uncertainty includes the effect of
model bias (or misspeciﬁcation) and is useful in interactive learning
environments arising in active learning or reinforcement learning. In addition
to discussing these properties of Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction
(DEUP), we illustrate its advantage against existing methods for uncertainty
estimation on downstream tasks including sequential model optimization and
reinforcement learning. We also evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates
from DEUP for probabilistic classiﬁcation of images and for estimating
uncertainty about synergistic drug combinations. Correlation of the predicted
uncertainty with the true generalization error, in addition to the OOD Detection
