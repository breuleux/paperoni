{"__type__": "Paper", "title": "A Remedy For Distributional Shifts Through Expected Domain Translation", "abstract": "Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts, \u201ccorrelation shifts,\u201d is caused by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching topic of \u201cdomain generalization.\u201d In this work, we employ multi-modal translation networks to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is sampled out-of-distribution. Learning a generative model from training domains enables us to translate each training sample under the special characteristics of other possible domains. We show that by training a predictor solely on the generated samples, the spurious correlations in training domains average out, and the invariant features corresponding to true correlations emerge. Our proposed technique, Expected Domain Translation (EDT), is benchmarked on the Colored MNIST dataset and drastically improves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy by 38% with train-domain validation model selection.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2107031526"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Soroosh Shahtalebi", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "28069645"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "F.

Our analysis reveals prominent longitudinal bands of fibers that are orthogonal to the well-known circumferential ones.

Whereas previous work was focus-ing on model variance, we propose a principled approach for directly estimating epistemic uncertainty by learning to predict generalization error and subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty, i.e., intrinsic unpredictability. This estimator of epistemic uncertainty includes the effect of model bias (or misspeci\ufb01cation) and is useful in interactive learning environments arising in active learning or reinforcement learning. In addition to discussing these properties of Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP), we illustrate its advantage against existing methods for uncertainty estimation on downstream tasks including sequential model optimization and reinforcement learning. We also evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates from DEUP for probabilistic classi\ufb01cation of images and for estimating uncertainty about synergistic drug combinations.
