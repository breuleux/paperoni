{"__type__": "Paper", "title": "Chunked Autoregressive GAN for Conditional Waveform Synthesis", "abstract": "Conditional waveform synthesis models learn a distribution of audio waveforms given conditioning such as text, mel-spectrograms, or MIDI. These systems employ deep generative models that model the waveform via either sequential (autoregressive) or parallel (non-autoregressive) sampling. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a common choice for non-autoregressive waveform synthesis. However, state-of-the-art GAN-based models produce artifacts when performing mel-spectrogram inversion. In this paper, we demonstrate that these artifacts correspond with an inability for the generator to learn accurate pitch and periodicity. We show that simple pitch and periodicity conditioning is insufficient for reducing this error relative to using autoregression. We discuss the inductive bias that autoregression provides for learning the relationship between instantaneous frequency and phase, and show that this inductive bias holds even when autoregressively sampling large chunks of the waveform during each forward pass. Relative to prior state-of-the-art GAN-based models, our proposed model, Chunked Autoregressive GAN (CARGAN) reduces pitch error by 40-60%, reduces training time by 58%, maintains a fast generation speed suitable for realtime or interactive applications, and maintains or improves subjective quality.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Max Morrison", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1397673526"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Rithesh Kumar", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "39458024"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Kundan Kumar", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2110802768"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Prem Seetharaman", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2855322"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Aaron C.

As part of a larger initiative to build a website that projects extreme climate events onto user-chosen photos, we present our solution to simulate photo-realistic floods on authentic images.

They have, however, been plagued by a slew of inherent \ufb02aws due to the intrinsic charac-teristics of chain-style conditional modeling (e.g., exposure bias or lack of long-range coherence), severely limiting their ability to model distributions properly. In this paper, we propose a unique method termed E-ARM for training autoregressive generative models that takes advantage of a well-designed energy-based learning objective. By leveraging the extra degree of freedom of the softmax operation, we are allowed to make the autoregressive model itself be an energy-based model for measuring the likelihood of input without introducing any extra parameters. Further-more, we show that E-ARM can be trained ef\ufb01ciently and is capable of alleviating the exposure bias problem and increase temporal coherence for autoregressive generative models.

A natural idea to mitigate this problem is to bias these algorithms toward more easily synthesizable molecules using a proxy score for synthetic accessibility. However, using currently available proxies can still result in highly unrealistic compounds. Here, we propose a novel approach, RetroGNN, to estimate synthesizability. First, we search for routes using synthesis planning software for a large number of random molecules. This information is then used to train a graph neural network to predict the outcome of the synthesis planner given the target molecule, in which the regression task can be used as a synthesizability scorer. We highlight how RetroGNN can be used in generative molecule-discovery pipelines together with other scoring functions. We evaluate our approach on several QSAR-based molecule design benchmarks, for which we find synthesizable molecules with state-of-the-art scores. Compared to the virtual screening of 5 million existing molecules from the ZINC database, using RetroGNNScore with a simple fragment-based de novo design algorithm finds molecules predicted to be more likely to possess the desired activity exponentially faster, while maintaining good druglike properties and being easier to synthesize. Importantly, our deep neural network can successfully filter out hard to synthesize molecules while achieving a 105 times speedup over using retrosynthesis planning software.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Cheng-Hao Liu", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1990744755"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Maksym Korablyov", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "41018927"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Stanislaw Jastrzebski", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "40569328"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Pawel Wlodarczyk-Pruszynski", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1445532660"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Yoshua Bengio", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1751762"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Marwin H.

GNNs have been applied to numerous domains ranging from quantum chemistry, recommender systems to knowledge graphs and natural language processing. A major issue with arbitrary graphs is the absence of canonical positional information of nodes, which decreases the representation power of GNNs to distinguish e.g. isomorphic nodes and other graph symmetries. An approach to tackle this issue is to introduce Positional Encoding (PE) of nodes, and inject it into the input layer, like in Transformers. Possible graph PE are Laplacian eigenvectors. In this work, we propose to decouple structural and positional representations to make easy for the network to learn these two essential properties. We introduce a novel generic architecture which we call LSPE (Learnable Structural and Positional Encodings).

The problem we address occurs in the context of two-stage stochastic programming, where the second stage is demanding computationally. We aim to predict at a high speed the expected TDOS associated with the second-stage problem, conditionally on the first-stage variables. This may be used in support of the solution to the overall two-stage problem by avoiding the online generation of multiple second-stage scenarios and solutions. We formulate the tactical prediction problem as a stochastic optimal prediction program, whose solution we approximate with supervised machine learning. The training data set consists of a large number of deterministic operational problems generated by controlled probabilistic sampling. The labels are computed based on solutions to these problems (solved independently and offline), employing appropriate aggregation and subselection methods to address uncertainty. Results on our motivating application on load planning for rail transportation show that deep learning models produce accurate predictions in very short computing time (milliseconds or less).

Such non-trivial dynamics lead to intriguing behaviors such as the phenomenon of \u201cdouble descent\u201d of the generalization error. The more commonly studied aspect of this phenomenon corresponds to model-wise double descent where the test error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity, beyond the classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins of the less studied epoch-wise double descent in which the test error undergoes two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. By leveraging tools from statistical physics, we study a linear teacher-student setup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that in deep neural networks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the evolution of generalization error over training. We find that double descent can be attributed to distinct features being learned at different scales: as fast-learning features overfit, slower-learning features start to fit, resulting in a second descent in test error.

{"__type__": "Paper", "title": "Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval", "abstract": "Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search \u2013 selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval \u2013 extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.1", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Sarthak Mittal", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "51519654"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Sharath Chandra Raparthy", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1498636613"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "I.

We view this problem from the perspective of margin-boosting and develop an algorithm for learning an ensemble with maximum margin. Through extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that our algorithm not only outperforms existing ensembling techniques, but also large models trained in an end-to-end fashion. An important byproduct of our work is a margin-maximizing cross-entropy (MCE) loss, which is a better alternative to the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss.

Traditional methods, such as molecular dynamics, sample conformations via computationally expensive simulations. Recently, machine learning methods have shown great potential by training on a large collection of conformation data. Challenges arise from the limited model capacity for capturing complex distributions of conformations and the difficulty in modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Inspired by the recent progress in deep generative models, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework to generate valid and diverse conformations given a molecular graph. We propose a method combining the advantages of both flow-based and energy-based models, enjoying: (1) a high model capacity to estimate the multimodal conformation distribution; (2) explicitly capturing the complex long-range dependencies between atoms in the observation space.

While the experiments were promising, the theoretical justification was incomplete. Our contribution is a theoretical investigation of the adaptation speed of simple two-variable SCMs. We use convergence rates from stochastic optimization to justify that a relevant proxy for adaptation speed is distance in parameter space after intervention. Using this proxy, we show that the SCM with the correct causal direction is advantaged for categorical and normal cause-effect datasets when the intervention is on the cause variable. When the intervention is on the effect variable, we provide a more nuanced picture which highlights that the fastest-to-adapt heuristic is not always valid.

We propose a novel imitation learning framework, and introduce new input features and architectures to represent branching.

{"__type__": "Paper", "title": "CausalWorld: A Robotic Manipulation Benchmark for Causal Structure and Transfer Learning", "abstract": "Despite recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL), it remains a challenge for agents to transfer learned skills to related environments. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose CausalWorld, a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The environment is a simulation of an open-source robotic platform, hence offering the possibility of sim-to-real transfer. Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The key strength of CausalWorld is that it provides a combinatorial family of such tasks with common causal structure and underlying factors (including, e.g., robot and object masses, colors, sizes). The user (or the agent) may intervene on all causal variables, which allows for fine-grained control over how similar different tasks (or task distributions) are. One can thus easily define training and evaluation distributions of a desired difficulty level, targeting a specific form of generalization (e.g., only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common parametrization facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an initial and a target task. While users may define their own task distributions, we present eight meaningful distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from simple to very challenging, all of which require long-horizon planning as well as precise low-level motor control. Finally, we provide baseline results for a subset of these tasks on distinct training curricula and corresponding evaluation protocols, verifying the feasibility of the tasks in this benchmark.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Ossama Ahmed", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2105538587"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Frederik Trauble", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "1749568051"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Anirudh Goyal", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "151354678"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Alexander Neitz", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "40390373"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "M.

It is often thought that this can be diagnosed visually using attribution (aka saliency) maps. We study if this assumption is correct. In some prediction tasks, such as for medical images, one may have some images with masks drawn by a human expert, indicating a region of the image containing relevant information to make the prediction. We study multiple methods that take advantage of such auxiliary labels, by training networks to ignore distracting features which may be found outside of the region of interest. This mask information is only used during training and has an impact on generalization accuracy depending on the severity of the shift between the training and test distributions. Surprisingly, while these methods improve generalization performance in the presence of a covariate shift, there is no strong correspondence between the correction of attribution towards the features a human expert has labelled as important and generalization performance. These results suggest that the root cause of poor generalization may not always be spatially defined, and raise questions about the utility of masks as \u201cattribution priors\u201d as well as saliency maps for explainable predictions.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "J.

Nous discutons de ces limites \u2014 en nous concentrant sur 2 enjeux pr\u00e9cis : la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation hors \u00e9chantillon et l\u2019attribution incorrecte des caract\u00e9ristiques \u2014 pour souligner l\u2019importance de conna\u00eetre les possibles failles des solutions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019apprentissage machine.", "authors": [{"author": {"name": "Joseph Paul Cohen", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2150027507"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Tianshi Cao", "roles": [], "aliases": [], "links": [{"type": "semantic_scholar", "link": "2143684642"}], "quality": [0.0]}, "affiliations": []}, {"author": {"name": "Joseph D.
