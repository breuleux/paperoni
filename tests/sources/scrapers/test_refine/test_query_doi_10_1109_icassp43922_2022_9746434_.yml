abstract: Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to
  the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts, “correlation shifts,” is caused
  by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching topic
  of “domain generalization.” In this work, we employ multi-modal translation networks
  to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is sampled out-of-distribution.
  Learning a generative model from training domains enables us to translate each training
  sample under the special characteristics of other possible domains. We show that
  by training a predictor solely on the generated samples, the spurious correlations
  in training domains average out, and the invariant features corresponding to true
  correlations emerge. Our proposed technique, Expected Domain Translation (EDT),
  is benchmarked on the Colored MNIST dataset and drastically improves the state-of-the-art
  classification accuracy by 38% with train-domain validation model selection.
