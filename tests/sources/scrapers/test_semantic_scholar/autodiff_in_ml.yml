abstract: We review the current state of automatic differentiation (AD) for array
  programming in machine learning (ML), including the different approaches such as
  operator overloading (OO) and source transformation (ST) used for AD, graph-based
  intermediate representations for programs, and source languages. Based on these
  insights, we introduce a new graph-based intermediate representation (IR) which
  specifically aims to efficiently support fully-general AD for array programming.
  Unlike existing dataflow programming representations in ML frameworks, our IR naturally
  supports function calls, higher-order functions and recursion, making ML models
  easier to implement. The ability to represent closures allows us to perform AD using
  ST without a tape, making the resulting derivative (adjoint) program amenable to
  ahead-of-time optimization using tools from functional language compilers, and enabling
  higher-order derivatives. Lastly, we introduce a proof of concept compiler toolchain
  called Myia which uses a subset of Python as a front end.
